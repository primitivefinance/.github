## Hi there!

Welcome to the Primitive Github

At Primitive, we aim to build the friendliest and most secure products in decentralized finance. We are optimistic about the possibilities available through collaboration, and we invite you to join us in creating better finance. Here, you will find the open-source code, resources, and documentation necessary to expand and build upon the RMM-01 protocol.
