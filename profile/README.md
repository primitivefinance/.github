## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the Primitive Github!

⚡️  At Primitive, we aim to build the friendliest and most secure products in decentralized finance. We are optimistic about the possibilities available through collaboration, and we invite you to join us in creating better finance. Here, you will find the open-source code, resources, and documentation necessary to expand and build upon the RMM-01 protocol.

🌈 If you are interested in contributing, please review our [contributing guidlines](https://github.com/primitivefinance/.github/pull/3/files?short_path=eca12c0#diff-eca12c0a30e25b4b46522ebf89465a03ba72a03f540796c979137931d8f92055). We welcome all contributors and maintaining a strong open-source collaborative work environment is in our best interest.

🥼 Because Primitive was built from research in the scientific community, we work hard to conduct high-quality, peer-reviewed work and collaborate with the scientific communities. Our research team is always happy to communicate with interested collaborators or Universities.
