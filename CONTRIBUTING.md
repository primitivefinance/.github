# How to contribute

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Primitive!

If you haven't already, come find us in our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/primitive).

Here are some important resources:

  * [FAQ](https://primitive.xyz/learn) Answers commonly asked questions,
  * [RMM Primer](https://primitive.mirror.xyz/Audtl29HY_rnhN4E2LwnP7-zjDcDGAyXZ4h3QpDeajg) is a great beginner friendly guide to RMMs and Primitive, and
  * [Whitepaper](https://primitive.xyz/whitepaper-rmm-01.pdf) is great if you want to dive into the details.
  * Our latest research on permision-less derivatives can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09890).

## Testing

We are strong believers of test driven development here. If you prepose new code, please write the corrosponding tests.

## Submitting changes

Please open a pull request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
The Primitive Team
